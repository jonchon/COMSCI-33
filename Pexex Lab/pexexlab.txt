I began this lab by using starting GDB. I used the following command
$ gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
Which launches GDB with the latest version of EMACS

Then I created a breakpoint for Ftimes in order to observe what happens 
when that function is called.
(gdb) break Ftimes

After setting the breakpoint, I ran the program 
(gdb) r -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

Next, I used the following command in order to see the machine code
and also get the columns that are needed for trace.tr
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on

I then looked online and found a command that would save all output
from gdb into gdb.txt.
(gdb) set logging on

Afterwards, I continuously pressed the following command until the
stack frame was no longer in arith_driver or Ftimes
(gdb) si

After getting the file, I moved gdb.txt into trace.tr
$ mv gdb.txt trace.tr

I then manually deleted every line that was uneccesary to trace.tr

Afterwards, in order to make trace.tr into the format required by the
specs, I used the command
$ cut -c16- trace.tr > trace2.tr
$ mv trace2.tr trace.tr

in order to get rid of the arrows in front of the lines and in order
to get rid of 0x and the unneeded zeros.

Then, looking at the format required by the specs, I noticed that I
did not need <arith_driver+...>: or <Ftimes+...>: Thus, I added spaces
in order to make them all have the same amount of digits after the '+'.
Then, I used the command
$ sed 's/..................//' trace.tr > trace2.tr
$ mv trace2.tr trace.tr

in order to get rid of the stack frame. While this code may look like it
would delete the location required by jump functions, it didn't because
the stack frame ends with ':', which makes it 18 characters as opposed to
the 17 characters after jump. Since there is no character after '>' in jump,
it does not delete the jump locations.

Next, I began to work on making the fourth column. I went back to GDB using
the commands above and used the commands in order to find the value of the
registers
(gdb) info registers ___
Where ___ is whatever register I needed to get information about.
I manually entered all of this information into the fourth column.
